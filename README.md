# Solving-Rubiks-Cube-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

The solution to a Rubik's Cube in a random state has been solved using Genetic Algorithm with a fitness function based on the number of incorrectly placed stickers in the cube. It is an evolutionary search algorithm where the solution is searched based on selection of the few of the closest states of the cube to the required solution in the current generation. These solutions are then combined and mutated to produce children with a better fitness value and the process is repeated until the required solution state is obtained.
